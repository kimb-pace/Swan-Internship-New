This is my working directory for my Rproject (Called "Swan-Internship-New.Rproj"). 

Folders: 

1. Annotated scripts: These are the annotated, cleaned, organized scripts that I have consolidated. They stand alone and have been tested. 

2. Data: This contains all of the data tables I used, both unmodified (those you gave me) and modified (those I manipulated in R and exported for easy use) 

3. Figures: Copies of all the NMDS figures I have made so far with various overlays 

4. Old_Scripts: Scripts that are NOT organized/cleaned. Many of these were consolidated and put into the cleaned/annotated scripts in various places- but I wanted to hold onto them just in case I needed some of the old code.
